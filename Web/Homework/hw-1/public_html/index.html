		<p align="left">A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are ao a single topic. 
		Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.This
		is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end,and thus help the reader
		see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.Paragraphscontain many different kinds of information.
		A paragraph could contain a series of brief examples or a single long illustration of a general point a series of.
		It might describe a place, character, or process; narrate Regardless of the kind of information they contain,

		A well-organized paragraph supports or develops a single controlling idea, which is expressed in a sentence
		and how the paragraph
		called the topic sentence. A topic sentence has several important functions: it substantiates or supports an essa
		thesis statement; it unifies the content of a paragraph and directs the order of the sentences; and it advises the 
		ader of the subject to be discussed and how the paragraph will discuss it. Readers generally look to the first few
		tences in a paragraph to determine the subject and perspective of the paragraph. That’s why it’s often best to put
		topic sentence at the very beginning of the paragraph. In some cases, however, it’s more effective to place anothe
		sentence before the topic sentence—for example, a sentence linking the current paragraph to the previous one, or o
		providing background information.</pre>
